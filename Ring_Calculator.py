# This python script will calculate the area of a ring, or the outer portion of a double circle, using a formula
# I created after noticing a similarity between the area formulas for circles and triangles. A guide to how I got
# there should also be on my GitHub. The formula assumes that the only given values are the circumferences of the
# two circles that make up the ring. ((C_Large^2) - (C_Small^2)) / (4Ï€)
